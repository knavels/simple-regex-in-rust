# Simple regex based on finite state machine in rust

the goal is to implement a simple regex that can recognize `'a' to 'z'`, `+`, `*` and `$`.

for the experimental purposes and fastet development speed, I decided to follow the ignorance of `Cargo` as tsoding did in his video, so I made a simple `Makefile` that "supposed" also to work properly in all operating systems.
